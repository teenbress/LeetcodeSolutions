# 541. Reverse String II

 > Link: [LeetCode 541](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string-ii/description/)
 ## Description
Given a string s and an integer k, reverse the first k characters for every 2k characters counting from the start of the string.
If there are fewer than k characters left, reverse all of them. If there are less than 2k but greater than or equal to k characters, then reverse the first k characters and leave the other as original.
Example 1:
```
Input: s = "abcdefg", k = 2
Output: "bacdfeg"
```

**Easy**  
- Time Complexity: O(N), Space Complexity: O(1)
```py
class Solution:
    def reverseStr(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:
        #sliding the string by every 2k characters
        # reverse the block directly by swaping characters in position [0:k]
        res = ''
        for x in range(0, len(s), 2*k):
            word = s[x:x+k+k]
            #print(word)
            res += word[0:k][::-1]+word[k:]
            #print(res)
        return res
        

```
