# 459. Repeated Substring Pattern
 > Link: [LeetCode 459](https://leetcode.com/problems/repeated-substring-pattern/description/)
 ## Description
Given a string s, check if it can be constructed by taking a substring of it and appending multiple copies of the substring together. 
Example 1:

```
Input: s = "abab"
Output: true
Explanation: It is the substring "ab" twice.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: s = "aba"
Output: false
```
Example 3:
```
Input: s = "abcabcabcabc"
Output: true
Explanation: It is the substring "abc" four times or the substring "abcabc" twice.
```
**Easy**  
- Time Complexity: O(N), Space Complexity: O(N)
```py
class Solution:
    def repeatedSubstringPattern(self, s: str) -> bool:
        n = len(s)
        for i in range(1, n//2+1):
            if n % i == 0:
                substring = s[:i]
                repetitions = n//i
                restructedString = substring * repetitions
                if s == restructedString:
                    return True
        return False

        
```
