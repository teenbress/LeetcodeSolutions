# 344. Reverse String
 > Link: [LeetCode 344](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/description/)
 ## Description
Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.
You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.  
Example 1:
```
Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
```

**Easy**  
- Time Complexity: O(N), Space Complexity: O(1)
```py
class Solution:
    def reverseString(self, s: List[str]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify s in-place instead.
        """
        left, right = 0, len(s)-1
        while left < right:
            s[left], s[right] = s[right], s[left]
            left += 1
            right -= 1

```
