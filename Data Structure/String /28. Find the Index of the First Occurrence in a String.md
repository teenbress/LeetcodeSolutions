# 28. Find the Index of the First Occurrence in a String
 > Link: [LeetCode 28](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-index-of-the-first-occurrence-in-a-string/description/)
 ## Description
Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.
Example 1:

```
Input: haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad"
Output: 0
Explanation: "sad" occurs at index 0 and 6.
The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: haystack = "leetcode", needle = "leeto"
Output: -1
Explanation: "leeto" did not occur in "leetcode", so we return -1.
```

**Easy**  
- Time Complexity: O(N), Space Complexity: O(N)
```py
class Solution:
    def strStr(self, haystack: str, needle: str) -> int:
        # sliding window
        m, n = len(haystack), len(needle)
        # the range is [0, m-n+1)
        for window_start in range(m-n+1):
            for i in range(n):
                if needle[i] != haystack[window_start+i]:
                    break
                if i == n-1:
                    return window_start
        return -1
        # time complexity: O(mn)
```
