# 977. Squares of a Sorted Array

 > Link: [LeetCode 977](https://leetcode.com/problems/squares-of-a-sorted-array/description/)
 ## Description
Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array of the squares of each number sorted in non-decreasing order.


Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [-4,-1,0,3,10]
Output: [0,1,9,16,100]
Explanation: After squaring, the array becomes [16,1,0,9,100].
After sorting, it becomes [0,1,9,16,100].
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [-7,-3,2,3,11]
Output: [4,9,9,49,121]
```
**easy**  
A **two pointers** approach should work well.
- Set one pointer `left` at start index, `right` pointer at the end index, a `i` pointer for updating value in nums;
- compare the absolute value in nums where pointers are pointing: if abs(nums[l] ) < abs(nums[r])
- update the num at nums`[i]` by square the absolute value
- time complex: O(N); space complex: O(N);

```py
class Solution:
    def sortedSquares(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        n = len(nums)
        res = [0] * n
        l, r = 0, n-1
        for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
            if abs(nums[l]) < abs(nums[r]):
                square = nums[r]
                r -= 1
            else:
                square = nums[l]
                l += 1
            res[i] = square * square
        return res
    
```
