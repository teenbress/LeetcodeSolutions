# 24. Swap Nodes in Pairs
 > Link: [LeetCode 204](https://leetcode.com/problems/swap-nodes-in-pairs/description/)
 ## Description
Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head. You must solve the problem without modifying the values in the list's nodes (i.e., only nodes themselves may be changed.)  
  
Example 1:

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [2,1,4,3]
```
Example 2:
```
Input: head = []
Output: []
```
Example 3:
```
Input: head = [1]
Output: [1]
```

```py
class Solution:
    def swapPairs(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        # set dummy, three pointers: prev, firstNode, secNode;
        dummy = ListNode(-1)
        dummy.next = head
        prev = dummy

        while head and head.next:
            firstNode = head
            secNode = head.next

            # swapping
            prev.next = secNode
            firstNode.next = secNode.next
            secNode.next = firstNode
            # initializing new nodes pair
            prev = firstNode
            head = firstNode.next
        return dummy.next
```
