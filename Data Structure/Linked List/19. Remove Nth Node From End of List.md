```py
class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: Optional[ListNode], n: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        dummy = ListNode(-1)
        dummy.next = head
        slow, fast = dummy, dummy
        # Advances fast pointer, keep the gap between fast and slow as n nodes
        for i in range(n):
            fast = fast.next
        # make sure fast.next is not null so that fast stops at the tail end
        while fast.next:
            fast = fast.next
            slow = slow.next
        slow.next = slow.next.next
        return dummy.next
