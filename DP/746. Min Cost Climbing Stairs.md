# 746. Min Cost Climbing Stairs
 > Link: [LeetCode 746](https://leetcode.com/problems/min-cost-climbing-stairs/description/)
 ## Description
You are given an integer array cost where cost[i] is the cost of ith step on a staircase. Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two steps.

You can either start from the step with index 0, or the step with index 1.

Return the minimum cost to reach the top of the floor.
Example 1:

```
Input: cost = [10,15,20]
Output: 15
Explanation: You will start at index 1.
- Pay 15 and climb two steps to reach the top.
The total cost is 15.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: cost = [1,100,1,1,1,100,1,1,100,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: You will start at index 0.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 2.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 4.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 6.
- Pay 1 and climb one step to reach index 7.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 9.
- Pay 1 and climb one step to reach the top.
The total cost is 6.

class Solution:
    def minCostClimbingStairs(self, cost: List[int]) -> int:
        dp0 = 0  # 初始值，表示从起点开始不需要花费体力
        dp1 = 0  # 初始值，表示经过第一步不需要花费体力
        
        for i in range(2, len(cost) + 1):
            # 在第i步，可以选择从前一步（i-1）花费体力到达当前步，或者从前两步（i-2）花费体力到达当前步
            # 选择其中花费体力较小的路径，加上当前步的花费，得到当前步的最小花费
            dpi = min(dp1 + cost[i - 1], dp0 + cost[i - 2])
            
            dp0 = dp1  # 更新dp0为前一步的值，即上一次循环中的dp1
            dp1 = dpi  # 更新dp1为当前步的最小花费
        
        return dp1  # 返回到达楼顶的最小花费


class Solution:
    def minCostClimbingStairs(self, cost: List[int]) -> int:
        res = [0] * (len(cost)+1)
        for i in range(2, (len(cost)+1)):
            one_step = res[i-1] + cost[i-1]
            two_step = res[i-2] + cost[i-2]
            res[i] = min(one_step, two_step)
        return res[-1]
